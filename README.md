# pla2dot

   This program converts the data structures used in the PLA [1] web-page to a
   file in DOT language used by the Graphviz [2] tool.

# Installation

   This program doesn't need to be compiled.

## Dependencies

   To run this script ***Python*** needs to be installed, together with the
   ***docopt*** module.
   ```bash
   pip install docopt
   ```
   For the output to be of any use you probably also want to have
   ***graphviz*** installed.

# Usage

   The input data for this script can be generated by viewing the source code
   of a web-page in the PLA [1] that contains a dependency graph. You will find
   a section looking something like
   ```
    <style type="text/css">
        #mynetwork {
            width: 600px;
            height: 400px;
            border: 1px solid lightgray;
        }
    </style>


    <script type="text/javascript">
        // create an array with nodes
        var nodes = new vis.DataSet([{id: 7, label: 'NEST code with abstracted neuron model representations', color: 'rgba(97,195,238,1.0)'},
        {id: 19, label: 'Streaming, steering and data analysis of NEST - VisNEST', color: 'rgba(97,195,238,1.0)'},
        ...
   ```
   Copy and paste the passages `create an array with nodes` and `create an
   array with edges` to a text file on your disk, e.g. "graph.data". Now you
   can convert this text to a dot-file and view it with graphviz as follows:
   ```bash
   ./pla2dot.py graph.data graph.dot
   dot -Tx11 graph.dot
   ```

   To get help about the usage type
   ```bash
   pla2dot --help
   ```

   currently this gives
    ```
    Usage: convert [options] <excerpt> <dotfile>
    
    Options:
        --rankdir=<dir>  either TB or LR [default: TB]
        -v, --verbose   tell what is going on
        -h, --help      print this text
   ```
